## Computed Property
Resulting value computed from one or more reactive properties. These are sort of encapsulated within the DerivedReactiveObject class you have, but they can also be a standalone concept.

## Watchers
These are essentially callbacks that listen for changes in reactive variables and execute when a change is detected. We have applied this in our above-mentioned classes.

## ReactiveMap
Much like ReactiveArray, you might find a need for a ReactiveMap if you're working with key-value collections.

## EventEmitter/Dispatcher
This class is responsible for managing and dispatching custom events. This is another straightforward way for various parts of your application to react to changes or actions.

## Binding/Sync class
This class facilitates connection between UI elements and corresponding reactive objects, replicating changes from one side to the other. For instance, a ReactiveInput class could automatically update its state (and the UI) based on a ReactiveObject and take user input to update the ReactiveObject.

## ReactiveStore
Keep a global or shared state that various parts of the application can react to. This is somewhat similar to concepts seen in flux architecture (e.g., Redux).

## Future/Promise Reactive Object
A reactive object that represents a value not known yet, such as a result of an asynchronous operation.

## ReactiveComponent
In a scenario where you have a reactive UI library, components themselves could be made reactive.
