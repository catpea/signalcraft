The Beauty Of Application Models In JavaScript: Frameworks Are Considered Evil

This book explores the power of utilizing JavaScript's object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities to create compelling application models, freeing developers of the constraints imposed by traditional JavaScript frameworks. It challenges the industry's heavy reliance on frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue, instead arguing for a more flexible, customizable, and efficient approach to building complex web applications. The book teaches developers how to leverage the core principles of JavaScript and OOP to build scalable and maintainable applications.
